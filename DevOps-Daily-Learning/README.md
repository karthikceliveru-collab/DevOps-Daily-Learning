---# DevOps & Cloud Learning Journey 🚀

Hi, I'm **Karthik Celiveru** — transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to **DevSecOps / Cloud**.

This repo documents my **daily learning** in Azure, AWS, Git, Terraform, CI/CD — and how I **use AI (ChatGPT/Copilot)** to speed up learning.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build hands-on Cloud & DevOps skills with small daily progress
- Use **AI as a co-pilot** for explanations, troubleshooting, and templates
- **Commit daily** for the next 30 days
- Land an entry-level **Cloud/DevSecOps** role

---

## 🤖 How I use AI (ChatGPT)
- Ask step-by-step for new topics (e.g., ASG vs NSG, Terraform basics)
- Generate starter templates (YAML, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions)
- Quick fix for errors (copy error → “explain + fix”)
- Summarize long docs into actionable steps
- Create checklists for labs and interviews

> All AI-assisted steps are **reviewed & tested** by me before committing.
